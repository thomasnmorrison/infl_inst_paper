% Setting up the problem

\section{Setup} \label{sec:setup}
We are interested in studying the effects of a localized feature in the inflationary potential.
\marginpar{
  Not sure if we want to cast things in terms of features in the potential or tie in more generally to the effects of instabilities.
}
In studying these effects it will prove useful to write the potential as a sum of two terms $V(\phi,\chi) = V_0(\phi,\chi) + \Delta V(\phi,\chi)$.
Conceptually we are starting with a baseline system and applying a stimulus by deforming the potential, $V_0$ being the baseline and $\Delta V$ being the stimulus.
The system's response can be calculated by taking the difference between two lattice simulations, one run with the deformed potential $V_0+\Delta V$ and the other with the baseline potential $V_0$, both starting from identical initial conditions.
Of particular interest in the cosmological context is the non-Gaussian component of $\zeta$ sourced by this response.

In this section we setup our system detailing the equations of motion, the form of the potential, and the source terms for $\zeta$.

\subsection{Equations of Motion}
% Talk about by convention we will choose $\phi$ displaced from the origin and driving inflation
% Define $H$, $a$, $\alpha$, $M_{Pl}$
% Define the naming convention $\phi_A$, $A=1,2$ as $\phi$, $\chi$.
% Discretization of the action

The action for a set of scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:action}
  S = \int \sqrt{-g}\left\{\frac{R}{2\mpl^2} - \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi^A\partial_\nu\phi^A - V \right\}\dd^4x.
\end{equation} 
Substuting the ansatz of an FRW metric $\dd s^2 = -a^2(\tau)\left( \dd\tau^2 \delta_{ij}\dd x^i\dd x^j \right)$ into \eqref{eq:action} and integrating by parts we arrive at the action
\begin{equation} \label{eq:actionFRW}
  S_{\mathrm{FRW}} = \int a^4\left\{
  - \frac{3}{\mpl^2}a'^2
  + \frac{1}{2}a^{-2}\sum_A\left[{{\phi^A}'}^2
  - \nabla\phi^A\cdot\nabla\phi^A\right]
  - V
  \right\}\dd\tau\dd^3x.
\end{equation}
%\marginpar{
%  Insert something about this is the action from which we will derive the equations of motion for our lattice simulations.
%}

Discretizing the action $S_{\mathrm{FRW}}$ on a cubic lattice of side length $l$ with $N$ equally space points along each dimension leads to the equations of motion
\begin{align} \label{eq:lat eom}
  & \frac{\dd\phi^A_i}{\dd\tau} = a^{-2}\Pi^A_i\\
  & \frac{\dd\Pi^A_i}{\dd\tau} = -a^2\nabla^2_\lat(\phi^A_j)_i -a^4\frac{\partial V_i}{\partial \phi^A_i}\\
  & \frac{\dd a}{\dd\tau} = -\frac{1}{6\mpl^2}\Pi^a\\
  & \frac{\dd\Pi^a}{\dd\tau} = -N^{-3}\sum_i\left\{
  \sum_A\left[-a^{-3}{\Pi^A_i}^2 + a\nabla_\lat(\phi^A_j)_i\cdot\nabla_\lat(\phi^A_j)_i \right]
  + 4a^3V_i\right\}.
\end{align}
Here the subscripts $i$ and $j$ run over lattice sites, $\Pi^A_i \equiv a^2{\phi^a_i}'$ and $\Pi^a \equiv -6\mpl^2a'$ are the momentum densities, and $\nabla_\lat$ and $\nabla^2_\lat$ are discrete gradient and Laplacian operators defined pseudospectrally.
Full details of the discretization proceedure can be found in the appendix.

%This leads to the cannonically conjugate pairs $(a,\Pi_a)$ and $(\phi_A,\Pi_{\phi_A})$ where $\Pi_a = -6a'/\mpl^2$. This gives the Hamiltonian density
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:hamiltonian}
%  \mathscr{H}(a,\Pi_a; \phi_A,\nabla\phi_A,\Pi_{\phi_A}) =
%  - \frac{\mpl^2}{12}\Pi_a^2
%  + \frac{1}{2}a^{-2}\Pi_{\phi_A}\Pi_{\phi_A}
%  + \frac{1}{2}a^2\nabla\phi_A\cdot\nabla\phi_A
%  + a^4V
%\end{equation}
%and the equations of motion
%\begin{align} \label{eq:eom}
%  &\frac{\dd a}{\dd\tau} = -\frac{\mpl^2}{6}\Pi_a \\
%  &\frac{\dd\Pi_a}{\dd\tau}  = -a^{-3}\Pi_{\phi_A}\Pi_{\phi_A} - a\nabla\phi_A\cdot\nabla\phi_A -4a^3V \\
%  &\frac{\dd\phi_A}{\dd\tau}  = a^{-2}\Pi_{\phi_A} \\
%  &\frac{\dd\Pi_{\phi_A}}{\dd\tau}  = a^2\nabla^2\phi_A - a^4V_{,\phi_A}.
%\end{align}

With \eqref{eq:lat eom} we have arrived at a Hamiltonian system which can be integrated frowards from intial conditions.
The system can be solved with an operator splitting method, the Hamiltonian can be split into three terms each with seperable equations of motion which can be integrated by a Yoshida symplectic integration scheme.
Details of the Hamiltonian splitting can be found in the appendix.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}
In order to evolve the system \eqref{eq:lat eom} forward in time we must specify initial conditions.
% What should I be talking about here?
% Assumption that perturbation theory can be used to set initial conditons for the lattice sim
% Setting via spectra or convolution
% Linear calculation
% 

\marginpar{
  Missing some words to define all the terms here. Should mention $\phi_A$, $A=1,2$ are also written $\phi$, $\chi$.
}  

%For our lattice simulations we assume a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric $\dd s^2 = -\dd t^2 +a^2(t) \delta_{ij}\dd x^i \dd x^j$ and couple to gravity only at the level of the energy constraint equation applied between a spatially uniform Hubble parameter and the lattice averaged energy density
\begin{equation} \label{eq:energy constraint}
  H^2 = \frac{1}{3M_{Pl}}\langle \rho \rangle_{\mathrm{Lattice}},
\end{equation} 
%where $H = \dot{a}/a$. We will commonly use $\alpha = \ln(a)$ in terms of which we can define the Hubble parameter $H = \dot{\alpha}$ and the slow-roll parameter $\epsilon = -\frac{\dd\ln H}{\dd \alpha}.$
%\marginpar{
%  Is it important to mention the terms we are throwing out of \eqref{eq:energy constraint} and \eqref{eq:fld eom} by imposing the FRW metric?
%}

%With the assumption of an FRW metric the canonical momenta of to fields $\phi_A$ are given by $\Pi_{\phi_A} = a^3\dot{\phi_A}$ and their equations of motion are
%\begin{align} \label{eq:fld eom}
%  %0 = \ddot{\phi_A} + 3H\dot{\phi_A} - \frac{\nabla^2}{a^2}\phi_A + V_{,\phi_A}
%  \frac{\dd}{\dd t} \phi_A &= a^{-3}\Pi_{\phi_A} \\
%  \frac{\dd}{\dd t} \Pi_{\phi_A} &= a^3\left(\frac{\nabla^2\phi_A}{a^2} - V_{,\phi_A}\right).
%\end{align} 

\subsection{Potential}
\Fpotential

\marginpar{
  I should explain the choice of potential here and what phenomenology we are hoping to capture. And give some motivation of looking at instabilities for generating NG. This is still the old potential
}

The forms of the baseline and stimulus to the potential we use are given by
\begin{align} \label{eq:potential}
  &V_0(\phi,\chi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2_\phi\phi^2 + \frac{1}{2}m^2_\chi\chi^2 \\
  &\Delta V(\phi,\chi) = \frac{1}{4}\lambda(\phi)\left[ (\chi^2-v^2)^2 - v^4 \right].
  %&\Delta V(\phi,\chi) = \frac{1}{2}\mu^2(\phi)\chi^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda_\chi\chi^4,
\end{align}
The form of $\Delta V$ is a symmetry breaking potential in the transverse field $\chi$. The term $\lambda(\phi)$ uses the longitudinal field $\phi$ as a clock to turn the symmetry breaking term on or off.

We have chosen a baseline potential $V_0$ which is quadratic in the fields to avoid nonlinearities in the baseline case.
To capture the phenomenology of symmetry breaking and restoration in the transverse direction we require $\lambda(\phi)$ to be a function with compact support.
For computational simplicity, we have chosen to paramtereize $\lambda(\phi)$ as a piecewise polynomial
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lambda}
  \lambda(\phi) =
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \quad \text{if } |\phi-\phi_p|\ge\phi_w \\
    \lambda_\chi\left[\left(\frac{\phi-\phi_p}{\phi_w}\right)^2 - 1 \right]^2 & \quad \text{if  } |\phi-\phi_p|<\phi_w
  \end{cases}.
\end{equation}
The parameters $\phi_p$ and $\phi_w$ control the placement and duration of the symmetry breaking and $\lambda_\chi$
scales its strength.

%here $\mu^2(\phi)$ modulates the interaction term and controls symmetry breaking/restoration in the $\chi$ direction.
%We have chosen a baseline potential $V_0$ which is quadratic in the fields to avoid nonlinearities in the baseline case and a simple functional form for $\mu^2(\phi)$ with the aim of capturing the phenomenology of a phase transitionduring inflation
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:m2 eff}
%  \mu^2(\phi)
%  \begin{cases}
%    0 & \quad \text{if } |\phi-\phi_p|\ge\phi_w \\
%    m^2_p - m^2_\chi + g^2(\phi-\phi_p)^2 -\frac{g^4}{4(m^2_\chi-m^2_p)}(\phi-\phi_p)^4 & \quad \text{if } |\phi-\phi_p|<\phi_w. \\
%  \end{cases}
%\end{equation} 
%The parameters $\phi_p$ and $\phi_w$ respectively control the position and width of the region where the potential is deformed.
%The parameter $m^2_p$ when negative controls the strength of the symmetry breaking in the $\chi$ direction.
%Requiring continuity of the potential and its first derivative fixes the term $g^2=2(m^2_\chi-m^2_p)/\phi_w^2$.

\marginpar{
  I haven't mentioned anywhere that inflation is primarily driven by $\phi$ (at least in the baseline case), but that seems like important information to the reader. 
}

Some reference to figure \ref{fig:potential} and general features of the potential..

\subsection{Sourcing $\zeta$}

\marginpar{
  I think this subsection should start with some general remarks about $\zeta$ before giving the $zeta$ source on the lattice.
}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:zeta differential}
  \delta\zeta = \frac{\delta\rho}{3(\rho + P)} + \delta\alpha
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:zeta source T}
  \dot{\zeta} = \frac{\partial_iT^i_0}{3(\rho+P)} + \delta H % check that this is correct
\end{equation} 

Computing \eqref{eq:zeta source T} for the fields on our lattice with $H$ spatially homogeneous we arrive at the following source equation for $\dot{\zeta}$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:zeta source fld}
  %\dot{\zeta} = \frac{\nabla\cdot(\dot{\phi})\nabla\phi + \nabla\cdot(\dot{\chi})\nabla\chi}{3a^2(\dot{\phi}^2+\dot{\chi}^2 +\frac{1}{3a^2}(\nabla\phi)^2 +\frac{1}{3a^2}(\nabla\chi)^2)}.
  \dot{\zeta} = \frac{\nabla\cdot(\dot{\phi_A}\nabla\phi_A)}{3a^2(\dot{\phi_A}\dot{\phi_A} +\frac{1}{3a^2}\nabla\phi_A\cdot\nabla\phi_A)}.
\end{equation} 
In our lattice simulations the source equation \eqref{eq:zeta source fld} is integrated alongside the field dynamics to compute the quantity $\zeta(t) - \zeta(t_0)$. 

The $\dot{\zeta}$ source \eqref{eq:zeta source fld} can be further divided into four terms
\begin{align}
  \dot{\zeta}_{\dot{\phi}\nabla^2\phi} & = \frac{\dot{\phi}\nabla^2\phi}{3a^2(\dot{\phi_A}\dot{\phi_A} +\frac{1}{3a^2}\nabla\phi_A\cdot\nabla\phi_A)}, \\
  \dot{\zeta}_{\nabla\dot{\phi}\cdot\nabla\phi} & = \frac{\nabla\dot{\phi}\cdot\nabla\phi}{3a^2(\dot{\phi_A}\dot{\phi_A} +\frac{1}{3a^2}\nabla\phi_A\cdot\nabla\phi_A)}, \\
  \dot{\zeta}_{\dot{\chi}\nabla^2\chi} & = \frac{\dot{\phi}\nabla^2\phi}{3a^2(\dot{\phi_A}\dot{\phi_A} +\frac{1}{3a^2}\nabla\phi_A\cdot\nabla\phi_A)}, \\
  \dot{\zeta}_{\nabla\dot{\chi}\cdot\nabla\chi} & = \frac{\nabla\dot{\chi}\cdot\nabla\chi}{3a^2(\dot{\phi_A}\dot{\phi_A} +\frac{1}{3a^2}\nabla\phi_A\cdot\nabla\phi_A)}.
\end{align}
The details of each of these term contributes to the total $\dot{\zeta}$ will be discussed in detail in section \ref{sec:results}.
However, it can be noted immediately that of these four terms only $\dot{\zeta}_{\dot{\phi}\nabla^2\phi}$ contributes at the linear level in field fluctuations. % should have a reminder that inflation is along the \phi direction.
% Mention how the $\dot{\zeta}_{\dot{\phi}\nabla^2\phi}$ is the stocastic inflation term.
\marginpar{
  Here I want to point out the stochastic inflation term and emphasize that we are also tracking $\zeta$ production through other channels.
}

It is worthwhile to note the form of NG and what measure will be sensitive to it are not always known a priori.
It is for this reason that the ability to make comparisons to a baseline potential on a realization by realization basis proves to be a major advantage of performing these calculations using lattice simulations.
\marginpar{
  I'm not sure if this is the place to discuss in detail isolating NG by computing $\Delta\zeta$ or if that fits more in the results section.
}
Some talk about $\Delta\zeta$.
\marginpar{
  I think we should give some emphasis to the idea that the form of NG that will be produced by a given physical mechanism is not known prior to a full calculation and so in order to properly measure NG the first step is to determine the informative statistics to measure.
}
