We would like to be able extract information about fundemental physics from inflation.
The approach we take is to conduct a numerical experiment.
We choose a feature of interest and smoothly embed it into a baseline potential.
The setup is akin to an in/out process. The attractor solution of the baseline potential provides the in state, the potential feature provides the interaction, and the baseline attactor again provides a comparison against which deviations in the out state are measured.
The quantity of interest is the excess production of $\zeta$ and its nonGaussian component in particular.

The way to think of this potential is not as a theory of inflation in its own right, but rather as cutting one feature out of a potentially feature rich potential, about which we remain largely agnostic, and transplanting it onto a simple and otherwise featureless background where it can be studied more easily.

In this paper we restrict ourselves to single isolated features in the potential. However, there are interesting questions to be asked about the possibility of correlated signals from a sequence of features. Such a scenario could be studied in much the same way.
