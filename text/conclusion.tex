\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
\textcolor{red}{[This section needs to be revised and expanded.]}
We have simulated the effects of a potential feature which breaks and restores a transverse symmetry during inflation. 
The response in the NG of $\zeta$ is measured and found to be concentrated in spatially intermittent prominant features.

It remains for future work to more thoroughly explore the parameter space of possible features imbedded in the inlationary potential and to classify these features by the form of NG produced.
