\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Field Dynamics}
% Start by explaining in broad terms the field dynamics
% Key points in field dynamics:
% symmetry breaking with initial linear growth of transverse fluctuations (squeezed state)
% effective horizon receives an effective mass correction and forms a condensate
% nonlinear $\chi$ - $\phi$ interactions have statistical homogeneity broken by the condensate realization
% particle production (still need to check if this is +k-k pairs or Bremstung)

% Plots to include:

\subsection{Average Inflation parameters}
% Discuss things like energy fractions and the slow roll parameters here.

\subsection{Sourcing $\zeta$}
% Explain the regimes of what source term is active


\subsection{$\zeta$ NG}
% This section will cover the peak statistics and realspace plots of $\Delta\zeta$
