\begin{abstract}
In this paper we examine the effects of a phase transitions during inflation.
In a two field model of inflation the transverse field is made to undergo symmetry breaking and symmetry restoration by means of a localized feature in the inflationary potential.
A lattice simulation is used to solve for the fully nonlinear field dynamics, the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$ sourced by these dynamics is integrated on the lattice.
Of particular interest is the resulting non-Gaussian contribution to $\zeta$ which we find to take the form of intermittent peaks in real space.
