\begin{abstract}
  The generation of non-Gaussianity during inflation is often viewed as a perturbative process. However, this view must be refined to account for broad classes of multifield phenomena which provide physical mechanisms through which non-perturbative sourcing of non-Gaussianity can occur.  The resulting non-Gaussianity can take forms radically different from those characterized by $f_{NL}$ and form structures uncorrelated with the underlying Gaussian field.
  Here we study one such mechanism, inflation proceeding through an incomplete phase transition, where the symmetry of a transverse field is dynamically broken and restored before the field settles in the new minima. Simulating the system on a lattice allows us to solve for the nonlinear dynamics and compute the contribution to the gauge invariant quantitiy $\zeta$. Of particular interest is the resulting non-Gaussianity of $\zeta$ which is spatially concentrated, forming intermittent peaks in real space.
